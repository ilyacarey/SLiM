# SLiM
Simulating hominin evolution with heterogeneous mutation rates and heterozygote instability for Part II Zoology Project (read it here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTMatJFPK0S1aAlFHSdNG91D8WjJ49n3/view).

This repository contains the code I wrote for my Part II Zoology Project, in which I use the forward simulation software SLiM to model various things that relate to hominin evolution. 

You can install SLiM by following the instructions manual: http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf

You can run the SLiM programs from command line or using SLiMgui, though you will need to change the directories within the programs. 

Each program should summarise what it does in the commenting in the first few lines, and most SLiM programs have accompanying R programs which plot and analyse the output data.
